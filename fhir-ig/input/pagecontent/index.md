## Introduction

This is an unofficial FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) that will be used to capture design decisions and discussions from the January 2026 HL7 Connecatathon. 

## Scope and Purpose
Implement the specification as outlined in https://github.com/Culby/smart-scheduling-links/blob/master/specification.md

### "SMART Scheduling Links" is a standards-based specification enabling patients to:

1. Find appointment slots using an appointment booking tool of their choice, searching by geography, specialty, health system, etc
2. Follow a deep link into the provider's booking portal, to book a specific slot
3. Complete a booking, e.g., by providing details, answering questions, or submitting referral documentation
